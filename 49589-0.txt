Transcriber's Notes: This work presents a series of full page
black-and-white photographs depicting various scenes along the Lehigh
Valley Railroad (in the eastern parts of the U.S. states of Pennsylvania
and New York), bound with an illustrated front cover.

In the HTML version the "full-size" linked illustration files are 50% of
the size as scanned, otherwise they would each be approximately 6M each,
and not well-suited for many mobile devices. A List of Illustrations has
been added as a convenience.

Aside from the title on the cover--and the publisher and copyright
information on its verso--the only text contained within is the
illustration captions. There is no body text.
